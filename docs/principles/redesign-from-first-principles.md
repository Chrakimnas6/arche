# Redesign From First Principles

When integrating a change, don't bolt it onto the existing design. Instead, redesign as if the change had been a foundational assumption from the start. The result should be the most elegant solution that would have emerged if we'd known about this requirement on day one.

- Read all affected files and understand the current design holistically
- Ask: "if we were writing this from scratch with this new requirement, what would we build?"
- Propagate the change through every reference -- types, docs, examples, rationale sections -- so nothing reads as a patch
- The redesign should be thought of holistically but delivered incrementally

This is the method for preserving [option value](./foundational-thinking.md) when integrating changes into an existing design.

In smart contracts, this matters doubly -- you cannot patch a deployed contract the way you patch a service. If a new requirement surfaces, redesign the contract interface as if that requirement existed from the start, rather than layering adapter logic on top.
